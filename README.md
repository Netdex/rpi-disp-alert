# rpi-disp-alert
I had an extra LCD panel and a Raspberry Pi lying around, so I decided to put them to good use by implementing 
what might possibly be the most unoriginal idea to ever exist. 

I wanted to know the time, the weather, and get notifications of any important events. And that's all it does, and 
nothing more (besides making it hard to fall asleep because of the bright backlight).
